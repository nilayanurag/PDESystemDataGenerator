This is a codebase to unify  the PDE system dataset generation for Physics-Informed Models. I will gradually include systems and evaluation


Libraries used:
- JAX
- PhiFlow
- 

Currently, I have included the following systems:
- 2D Navier-Stokes - Flow over a cylinder



## Installation
```
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba env update -f environment.yml --prune
```
